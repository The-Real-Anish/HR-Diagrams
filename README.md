# HR-Diagrams

A project dedicated to understanding the process of stellar evolution, and analyzing star clusters.

# Files

* The catalog has been taken from the "meth01" file in https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/hugs/ . It has a file size of over 118MB, and is the only input involved in the code.

* color_mag.py makes a color-magnitude diagram by generating a bubble chart of the difference in apparent magnitudes v/s F275W magnitude.

* cluster_diagram.py uses stellar positions as well as apparent magnitudes to plot an approximaion of the star cluster from the snapshot.

* diagram.png shows the CMD generated by color_mag.py.

* cluster.png shows the visualization created by cluster_diagram.py
