# HR-Diagrams

A project dedicated to understanding the process of stellar evolution, and analyzing star clusters.

# Files

* The catalog has been taken from the "meth01" file in https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/hugs/ . It has a file size of over 118MB.

* color_mag.py currently makes an inverse plot the difference in apparent magnitudes versus column 3

<<<<<<< HEAD
* cluster_diagram.py uses stellar positions as well as apparent magnitudes to plot an approximaion of the star cluster from the snapshot. Unlike color_mag, it also filters out stars with low probability using the probability column.
